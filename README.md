Noxesium
---
A fabric mod with feature additions, bugfixes, and performance improvements. It allows servers to offer a better experience to clients through access to additional features beyond vanilla limitations.

Server developers are welcome to submit additional patches they need, however all non-performance changes must be fully optional to use. No client-side configuration is available as behaviour should be decided by the server.

# Features

### Additions
- Sends information about GUI scale to connected servers to allow better server-side UI design
- Allow servers to disable riptide trident collisions
- Allow servers to define a global CanDestroy and CanPlaceOn tag that applies to all items
- Allow servers to show player heads in chat messages

### Performance
- Optimized Beacon block entity rendering (disabled when using Iris Shaders)

### Bugfixes
- Always display head layer in TAB menu
- Change teleport packets to teleport vehicle passengers to their vehicle
- Fixes lighting issues with moving piston walls
- Fixes custom models sometimes disappearing when not looking at the center

### MCC Island-specific Features
- Adds a setting to show player heads in UIs


# For developers
## Message Channels
Noxesium communicates with the server over plugin messaging channels. The namespace of these channels matches the current API version of Noxesium, which is currently `v1`. Currently, there are 4 messaging channels available.

`noxesium-v1:client_information` (client -> server); Contains the Protocol version of the mod version used by the client. This is sent right after a client joins the server. If a proxy server is used it's recommended to cache this value per session on the server-side. Protocol versions are bumped when major new capabilities are introduced so servers can disable features for outdated mod users. E.g. the introduction of player head components caused a protocol bump so MCC Island can disable the setting for users with an older mod version.

`noxesium-v1:client_settings` (client -> server); Contains information about the settings used by the client. Sent when a player joins a server or whenever the player changes their settings.

`noxesium-v1:server_rules` (server -> client); Can be used to modify the current values of server rules known to this client. You should not mark rules being changed for reset, the client avoids triggering changes if a rule's value did not change.

## Server Rules
Server Rules are a system similar to Game Rules but able to be modified whenever desired. Server Rule settings are cleared whenever a player disconnects from a server. These values allow a server to affect the client's state easily. Below is a list of every server rule currently available and their data format in the plugin message:

**Disable Auto Spin Attack**. Disables colliding with other entities while riptiding. This also prevents the spin attack from dealing any damage to entities moved through.

|Value            |Boolean          |`false` by default.|
