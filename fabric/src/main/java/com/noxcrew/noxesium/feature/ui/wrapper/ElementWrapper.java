/**
 * Wraps a single UI element. Handles caching previously drawn frames of the UI element
 * if no changes are detected in it.
 * <p>
 * If [requestRedraw] is called a new frame is drawn immediately on the next frame. Alternatively
 * if some variable changes a redraw also happens immediately on the next frame.
 * <p>
 * Beyond that UI elements are drawn at most 20 times per second, that is, a new UI frame is drawn
 * only after 50ms have passed since the start of the last draw call. This is more than reasonable
 * especially since we use variables for fades/animations to make them frame accurate (as we could
 * otherwise not pick a reasonable limit without judging the smoothness of some value). That is,
 * giving a configuration option to pick the frame rate to use for the UI causes people to configure
 * this value based on their judgement of smoothness of the UI. We don't want the desired smoothness
 * of rare events to make people run many unnecessary updates at all times. We should detect animations
 * and stop optimizing until they are over, re-enabling optimizations when they are useful.
 * <p>
 * The intent is for this 20 times per second cap to only apply to complicated or trivial effects.
 * E.g. the F3 screen or blinking hearts in TAB. Both effects may chance on any frame but they are not
 * animations and the user won't actually need to see what happens on the frames we skip.
 * <p>
 * For any animations such as text fading in we should ensure this gets animated correctly.
 * <p>
 * ----
 * <p>
 * We apply a complicated system to determine when redrawing needs to happen outside of specific requests.
 * This is necessary because there are a number of effects that could cause any piece of UI to become unpredictable:
 * - Another mod can inject some unexpected behavior
 * - Any obfuscated text changes character constantly
 * - Text shaders can rely on the game time to completely change text rendering
 * <p>
 * This is why we go for a dynamic approach, we always render 2 frames in a row and if the second frame is identical
 * to the first we skip a frame, if frame 4 still matches we skip 2 frames, etc. This allows for a slow ramp into
 * the possible maximum frame skippage without missing out on animations that we just didn't catch. In addition to
 * this we always render 1 frame every second anyway to ensure we don't get too out of sync, but if that frame
 * stays identical we wait for the next full second before trying again. (so after 1 second of no changes we basically
 * render the UI at 1 fps)
 * <p>
 * ----
 * <p>
 * This feature has gone through various iterations but has now landed on the approach of optimizing
 * around the UI code instead of directly reworking the UI code itself. It's up to Mojang to make optimizations
 * to individual UI components, or to improve text rendering in general, but this requires too many
 * changes to too much code which causes a lot of instability with other projects, and prevents Noxesium
 * from being able to support any of them. Instead, the approach is to optimize when we render frames
 * in a friendly way while still obtaining maximum performance.
 * <p>
 * The small loss of performance by not drawing text 2% more efficiently is greatly outweighed by even
 * a 2x reduction in frames on which UI is rendered. We can settle for drawing UI on 6 instead of 2 frames
 * within a 1 second window on 60fps. Actually drawing a UI is not terribly performance demanding anyway,
 * it's just the repetition.
 * <p>
 * ----
 * <p>
 * It should be noted that most of this is not yet implemented (hence why experimental optimizations are
 * currently fully un-available), the main problem is figuring out how to determine if frames have changed
 * or not. It seems to be fairly complicated, but the problem is not solvable in an actual nice way without
 * it from a conceptual level. So this'll stay disabled for a while until I solve that.
