# Legacy Paper API

This is a collection of legacy code that can run on the server-side under Paper to interact with Noxesium clients on v0, v1, and v2. This
code is no longer maintained and exists here for supporting older Noxesium clients. All plugin channels use different ids for v3 so you can
run them alongside one another.
