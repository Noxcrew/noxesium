 * server is expected to be able to use to interact with a client.

 * It is generally expected that servers take the burden of updating first. Clients will change to expect
 * the latest protocol, where possible supporting older deprecated packets. Servers should continue implementing
 * legacy support for older versions going back as far as they allow to join, however.
